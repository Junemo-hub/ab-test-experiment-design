    "- Run follow-up experiments including additional KPIs such as time on page or scroll depth.\n",
    "- Consider subgroup A/B testing by country or device type to detect regional effects.\n",
    "- Experiment with other UX/UI elements (e.g., CTA wording, product recommendations) to potentially improve conversion.\n"
